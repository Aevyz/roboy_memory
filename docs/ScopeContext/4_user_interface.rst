User Interfaces
---------------

There is a GUI for development purposes provided by Neo4j.
In order to invoke the GUI, a user has to run a Neo4j instance, open a browser and go to::
	
	http://localhost:7474

or if using a remote Neo4j instance::

	http://85.10.197.57:7474

which is the Roboy server.

All other parts of the module are provided without GUI and offer interaction on a command line level.
